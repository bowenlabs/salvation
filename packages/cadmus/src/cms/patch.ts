/**
 * Patch model + field-level diff (issue #14) — adopts Sanity's mutation/patch
 * idea (pattern, not code): represent a content change as a small set of
 * field operations, and compute a field-level diff between two document
 * snapshots. Underpins version-history display (what changed between two
 * versions) and the content-migration runner (#18), which expresses a
 * transform's effect as a {@link Patch} and applies it.
 *
 * Scope: operations are keyed by **top-level field** (a document's own
 * fields), matching "field-level diff" — a changed `blocks` array reads as
 * one changed field, not a deep per-node diff. Deep/array-aware diffing is a
 * deliberate later extension, not built here.
